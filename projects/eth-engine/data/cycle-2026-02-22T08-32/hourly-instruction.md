# Hourly Trading Instruction (from MiniMax Brain)

**Time:** 2026-02-22T06:15:17Z
**Valid until:** 2026-02-22 14:33:57 UTC

## EXECUTE THIS PLAN:
- **Action:** OPEN LONG
- **Symbol:** ETH
- **Size:** $15 at 3x leverage
- **Entry:** market
- **Stop Loss:** $1960.0 (MANDATORY)
- **Take Profit:** $2020.0
- **Confidence:** 60%

## WHY:
Contrarian bullish setup: Fear & Greed at 9 (Extreme Fear - historically bullish reversal signal), Daily RSI at 38.0 (oversold), price near Bollinger lower band (1965.91). EMA 12 crossing above EMA 26 suggesting momentum shifting bullish. ETH rejected from $2015 area, now consolidating near support. On-chain stale so reducing confidence. Using $15 at 3x for $45 exposure with tight SL at 1960.

## RULES:
- Execute this plan ONCE, then HOLD until next hourly instruction
- Do NOT overtrade - one entry per hour max
- If already in a position matching this direction, HOLD (do not double up)
- If in opposite position, CLOSE first then open new
- SL is non-negotiable. Never remove SL.
