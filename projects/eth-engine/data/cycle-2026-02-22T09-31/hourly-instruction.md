# Hourly Trading Instruction (from MiniMax Brain)

**Time:** 2026-02-22T14:31:09Z
**Valid until:** 2026-02-22 15:31:47 UTC

## EXECUTE THIS PLAN:
- **Action:** OPEN LONG
- **Symbol:** ETH
- **Size:** $0 at 0x leverage
- **Entry:** market
- **Stop Loss:** $None (MANDATORY)
- **Take Profit:** $None
- **Confidence:** 0%

## WHY:
Bearish setup confirmed: price dropped $30 from $1980 to $1950 with high volume selloff (28k at 08:00). Price below daily SMA 20 (1949 < 2016). 1H EMA bearish cross (1967 < 1970). MACD histogram negative (-3.1). On-chain shows clear distribution: $13.6M stablecoin net selling, whales moving -$11.6M OUT of exchanges, ETH reserves down 5,891 ETH in 1h. Gas rising. Only 1 confirming signal (RSI oversold at 32), but rules: oversold can get MORE oversold in downtrends. Need 2+ confirming signals for any trade. With strong bearish evidence across all 3 pillars (price action, technicals, on-chain), no_trade is correct.

## RULES:
- Execute this plan ONCE, then HOLD until next hourly instruction
- Do NOT overtrade - one entry per hour max
- If already in a position matching this direction, HOLD (do not double up)
- If in opposite position, CLOSE first then open new
- SL is non-negotiable. Never remove SL.
