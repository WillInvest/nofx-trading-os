MACD histogram negative (-3.1). On-chain shows clear distribution: $13.6M stablecoin net selling, whales moving -$11.6M OUT of exchanges, ETH reserves down 5,891 ETH in 1h. Gas rising. Only 1 confirming signal (RSI oversold at 32), but rules: oversold can get MORE oversold in downtrends. Need 2+ confirming signals for any trade. With strong bearish evidence across all 3 pillars (price action, technicals, on-chain), no_trade is correct.",
