# Hourly Trading Instruction (from MiniMax Brain)

**Time:** 2026-02-22T14:46:15Z
**Valid until:** 2026-02-22 15:46:45 UTC

## EXECUTE THIS PLAN:
- **Action:** OPEN LONG
- **Symbol:** ETH
- **Size:** $0 at 0x leverage
- **Entry:** market
- **Stop Loss:** $None (MANDATORY)
- **Take Profit:** $None
- **Confidence:** 0%

## WHY:
All three pillars align BEARISH: (1) Node shows distribution pattern, (2) Price broken below SMA 20 with bearish EMA cross and negative MACD, (3) News mixed with yen carry unwind. Only 1 confirming signal (RSI oversold) but rules explicitly state oversold can get MORE oversold in downtrends. Need 2+ confirming signals for any directional trade. With 7 opposing signals and strong bearish alignment across all metrics, no_trade is the disciplined choice.

## RULES:
- Execute this plan ONCE, then HOLD until next hourly instruction
- Do NOT overtrade - one entry per hour max
- If already in a position matching this direction, HOLD (do not double up)
- If in opposite position, CLOSE first then open new
- SL is non-negotiable. Never remove SL.
