  "node_analysis": "On-chain shows STRONG distribution: $13.6M stablecoin net selling, whales moving -$11.66M OUT of exchanges, ETH reserves depleted by 5,891 ETH in 1 hour. Gas rising. Smart money is clearly distributing, not accumulating. This is bearish.",
  "price_analysis": "Price broken below daily SMA 20 (1944 < 2016), 1H EMA bearish cross (1966 < 1970), MACD histogram deeply negative (-3.44). RSI at 29.87 is oversold BUT price continues dropping with high volume (28k at 08:00). Oversold can get MORE oversold in downtrends. This is bearish.",
  "news_analysis": "Fear & Greed at 9 (Extreme Fear). 2 bullish headlines but Yen Carry Trade unwinding is bearish for risk assets. Extreme Fear is NOT automatically bullish - it can persist for weeks. Mixed/neutral signal overall.",
  "chain_of_thought": "All three pillars align BEARISH: (1) Node shows distribution pattern, (2) Price broken below SMA 20 with bearish EMA cross and negative MACD, (3) News mixed with yen carry unwind. Only 1 confirming signal (RSI oversold) but rules explicitly state oversold can get MORE oversold in downtrends. Need 2+ confirming signals for any directional trade. With 7 opposing signals and strong bearish alignment across all metrics, no_trade is the disciplined choice.",
