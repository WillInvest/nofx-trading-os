Price now BELOW daily SMA 20, 1H EMA 12/26 bearish cross (1967 < 1970), MACD histogram negative (-3.04). 1H RSI at 33 is oversold but price continues down. Two big red candles with volume spike suggest selling pressure. Rules: if price below daily SMA 20 with bearish EMA cross, bias should be short or no_trade, NOT contrarian long. On-chain and market data unavailable = no on-chain confirmation. With <2 confirming signals and stale data, no_trade is the correct decision.",
