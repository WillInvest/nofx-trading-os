## Scan result: BTC SHORT candidate found!
- Arena found: OPEN_SHORT BTCUSDT @ 70% confidence, 3x leverage, SL 1.5%, TP 4.5%
- Reasoning: "Technical resistance confluence with institutional outflow and bearish OI pattern"
- This is only the second directional call today. The first SHORT call (9 AM) you correctly didn't take because flow contradicted it.

## How to evaluate this:
- 70% confidence is below your 75% threshold. Check if YOUR 5m data confirms:
  - Is institutional outflow active right now?
  - Is OI declining with price flat/up (bearish accumulation)?
  - Is RSI overbought at resistance?
- If all three confirm → the case is strong, you may enter with reduced size
- If flow has flipped to inflow again (like 9 AM) → WAIT is fine

## Position management if you enter:
- SL 1.5% is tight for BTC at 3x leverage. That's a ~$3 risk on a ~$77 position. Manageable.
- TP 4.5% is ambitious. Consider taking partial profit at 2-3%.
- Friday night = thin liquidity. Wicks are real. Don't get stopped on noise.
