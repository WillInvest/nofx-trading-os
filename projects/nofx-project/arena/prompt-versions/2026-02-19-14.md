# Prompt Version - 2026-02-19 14:00 EST

## Changes Made
- Updated custom_prompt with new hourly plan from debate b8f4dcb0
- Consensus: BULLISH (both bull and bear agree on long BTC)
- Bull confidence: 85%, Bear confidence: 75%

## Issues Found
1. **CRITICAL: Token overflow** - Debate engine hit 246K tokens vs 131K limit on some debates
   - Cause: Market data context too large when accumulated over rounds
   - Recommendation: Truncate market data or summarize between rounds
2. **nofx-trading container unhealthy** - Needs investigation
3. **Fao order execution failing** - "Failed to get 5-minute K-line from Hyperliquid" for ORCAUSDT
   - Hyperliquid API returning 500 errors for some coins
4. Fao's previous decision (ORCA short) did NOT reference hourly plan in CoT
   - Strategy prompt sections already include plan reference instructions
   - Updated custom_prompt with fresh plan data

## Prompt Sections (unchanged)
- role_definition: Trader Fao short-term executor role
- trading_frequency: 2-4 trades/day max
- entry_standards: OI + fund flow alignment required
- decision_process: Reference hourly plan mandatory
