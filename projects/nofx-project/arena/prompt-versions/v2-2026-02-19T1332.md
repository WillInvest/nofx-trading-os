# Prompt Version v2 - 2026-02-19 13:32 EST

## Changes from v1
1. **Added Hourly Plan Integration** to `role_definition` - Trader Fao must now consult and reference the hourly plan in every decision
2. **Added Stop Loss Discipline** to `entry_standards` - Explicit SL ranges for BTC/ETH (1.5-2.5%) and altcoins (2-4%), breakeven rule at +2%
3. **Simplified decision_process** - Now starts with "Reference hourly plan" as step 1
4. **Shortened prompts** - Removed verbose explanations to reduce token usage

## Motivation
- Trader Fao's decisions were NOT referencing the hourly plan at all
- No explicit stop loss guidelines existed in the prompt
- Decision process didn't enforce plan-first thinking
