### Bull (R3)
- Conceded momentum is weak (+0.11% 1h, -0.11% 4h)
- Conceded resistance at $66,950-$66,975 with multiple rejections
- Strongest point: institutional inflow +$17.07M, OI +$12.87M

### Bear (R3)
- Conceded institutional inflows are strong and legitimate
- Conceded OI increase supports bullish bias
- Strongest point: RSI divergence, declining volume, resistance rejections

### Judge
- open_short at 68% confidence
- Correctly weighted both sides
- Opus overrode to HOLD (we already have a long, and 68% is below threshold for new trades)

### Quality: ★★★★ (Best of the day)
- Both sides made genuine concessions
- Data-driven arguments throughout
- Judge verified data per-coin correctly
