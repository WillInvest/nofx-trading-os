### ⚠️ DEGRADED DEBATE — Context Length Overflow
The debate hit DeepSeek's 131K token limit (requested 246K tokens). Bull and bear rounds failed to produce arguments. The "completed" status is misleading — only the voting/judge phase produced output.

### Final Decision (Judge Only)
- **Action:** open_short BTCUSDT
- **Confidence:** 78%
- **Leverage:** 2x
- **SL:** 2.5%, **TP:** 5%
- **Reasoning:** BTC approaching $67K-$68K resistance with mixed institutional flows (+$100M 4h vs -$276M 24h). Short covering rallies exhaust at resistance.

### Issues
1. **Context overflow**: Adding `selected_timeframes: ["5m","15m","1h","4h"]` for 20+ coins with klines caused 246K tokens — far exceeding 131K limit
2. **No actual debate occurred** — bull and bear never spoke
3. **Judge made decision with limited context** — only market data, no debate arguments

### Root Cause
The strategy had `use_hyper_main: true` (20 coins) + 4 timeframes × 50 klines each = massive context. Need to either:
- Reduce coin count for debates
- Reduce timeframes/kline count for debates  
- Use a model with larger context window
