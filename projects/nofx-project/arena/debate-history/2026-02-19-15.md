**Status:** ✅ Completed with 6 messages (3 rounds, bull + bear)

### Fix Applied This Hour
- Added `selected_timeframes: ["1h"]` to strategy klines config
- Reduced `primary_count` to 20
- This fixed the 246K token context overflow that broke debates at 14:02 and 14:12

### Bull Thesis (Round 3)
- BTC at $67,042 in strong bullish trend
- Massive institutional inflow +$24.95M in 1h
- Short covering pattern: OI -5.19M with price up +0.17%
- Price above EMA20 ($66,868) and EMA50 ($66,691)
- Targets: continue long BTC, 5x leverage
- Secondary: ETH long (short covering + inflow)

### Bear Thesis (Round 3)
- BTC in resistance zone $67K-$68K
- Agrees with long direction but urges tight risk management
- RSI 62.31 approaching overbought territory
- Stop loss discipline critical at resistance
- Concern: ETH OI dropping -14.77M (large)

### Final Decision (Consensus)
- **Action:** open_long BTCUSDT
- **Confidence:** 77%
- **Leverage:** 5x
- **SL:** 1.875%, **TP:** 4.125%
- Both bull and bear agree on long direction — rare consensus

### Debate Quality
- ✅ Both sides used real OI numbers, institutional flow data
- ✅ Referenced the hourly plan explicitly
- ⚠️ Bull and bear are too aligned — not enough adversarial tension
- ⚠️ Bear should be more skeptical; just agreeing with lower confidence isn't useful debate
