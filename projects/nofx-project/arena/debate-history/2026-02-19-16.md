## Debate ID: 029b4b3a-10ff-4b57-a0fe-bf12fe8904f8
**Status:** ✅ 7 messages (3 rounds + judge). Real debate with genuine clash.

### Opus Instruction
"BTC LONG from $66,390 is +5.6% profit near peak. Focus on: take profit or hold? Momentum exhausting or accelerating? Bear: challenge hold thesis. Bull: defend with data."

### Bull (Round 3 Summary)
- BTC RSI 64.66 is healthy bullish, NOT overbought
- Institutional accumulation: +$30.62M inflow vs retail selling -$6.55M
- OI up + price up = strongest bullish pattern
- Defended against bear's "exhaustion" narrative with data

### Bear (Round 3 Summary)
- Conceded BTC bull case has merit (RSI not overbought, institutional backing)
- ETH severely overbought RSI 75.59 with OI declining
- ZECUSDT RSI 77.82 extremely overbought
- Short covering rallies eventually exhaust

### Judge Decision
- **Called open_short BTC at 72% confidence** ⚠️
- **PROBLEM:** Judge cited "RSI 75.59 severely overbought" for BTC — but that's ETH's RSI!
- BTC's actual RSI is 64.66 (neutral-bullish)
- Opus overrode to cautiously_bullish based on correct data

### Quality Assessment
- ✅ Bull and bear had genuine clash (not just agreeing)
- ✅ Bear conceded where bull was stronger (good debate hygiene)
- ✅ Real data cited throughout (OI numbers, institutional flows)
- ⚠️ Judge confused RSI values between coins — needs better prompt about verifying data per-symbol
- ⚠️ Bear still too willing to concede — could push harder
