# Submissions Requiring Manual Review

The following submissions could not be automatically graded due to PDF extraction issues (likely image-based PDFs, heavy handwriting, or OCR failures).

## Unreadable Submissions

| Student | File | Issue |
|---------|------|-------|
| Agerup, Dennis | agerupdennis_*.pdf | No text extracted |
| D'Souza, Freya | dsouzafreya_*.pdf | No text extracted (12MB file) |
| Horgan, John | horganjohn_*.pdf | No text extracted |
| McLoughlin, Jude | mcloughlinjude_*.pdf | No text extracted |

## Partial Extractions

| Student | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| Hauk, Anna | Problems 1.4 partially cut off |
| Brandon Tanaka | Only Problem 1.4 visible (Excel format) |
| Brooks, Taylor | Problems 1.3-1.5 not visible |
| Freire, Roberto | No numerical values extracted for most problems |
| Meyer, Ara | No answers visible - only problem statements |

## Recommended Action

1. **Open each PDF manually** in a PDF viewer
2. **Use the GRADING_SUMMARY.md** reference values to verify answers
3. **Apply the rubric**:
   - Correct formula, wrong numbers: -1 per error
   - Very large errors: -2 to -3 points
   - Wrong approach or missing: -10 to -20 per problem

## Note on Problem 1.3 Common Error

Many students incorrectly use simple daily rate = APR/365 instead of the proper conversion:

- **Wrong**: r_daily = 0.1715/365 → Balance = $10,141.92
- **Correct**: r_daily = (1+0.1715)^(1/365) - 1 → Balance = $10,130.95

The problem states APR uses "annualized compounding" which means the APR IS the effective annual rate, requiring conversion to equivalent daily rate.

Some instructors accept $10,141.92 if the simpler interpretation is taught. **Check with course instructor on convention.**
