**If problems 1.3-1.5 are missing**: 39/100
**If problems exist elsewhere**: Need manual verification

**Confidence**: LOW for overall grade — ONLY 1 PAGE EXTRACTED

**Critical Issue**: The submitted PDF appears to contain only 1 page. This is likely an incomplete submission. The student should be contacted to verify if they intended to submit more pages.

**Uncertainty Summary**:
1. Only 1 page visible from submission
2. Problems 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 completely missing
3. Continuous compounding (1.2iii) partially cut off
4. **ACTION REQUIRED**: Contact student or check for resubmission
