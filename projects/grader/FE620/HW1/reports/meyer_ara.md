## Problem 1.3 (18/20)

| Item | Student Answer | Correct Answer | Status |
|------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| Balance | $10,141.957 | $10,130.95 | -2 |

**Comments**: Used formula =B44*EXP(B47) which applies continuous compounding to the rate calculation. This is an approximation error — problem asks for daily compounding.

⚠️ **UNCERTAINTY**: The formula suggests using continuous compounding (EXP function) but with rate*time = 0.014096. This doesn't match either the simple APR/365 approach or the proper daily conversion. May need to verify Excel formulas.

## Problem 1.4 (NOT FULLY VISIBLE)

⚠️ **UNCERTAINTY**: Problem 1.4 not visible in extracted pages. Need to check additional pages or verify submission completeness.

---

## Problem 1.5 (NOT FULLY VISIBLE)

⚠️ **UNCERTAINTY**: Problem 1.5 not visible in extracted pages.

## Final Grade: 58/60 visible (scaled ~97 if complete)

**Confidence**: LOW for overall grade — Problems 1.4-1.5 not extracted

**Uncertainty Summary**:
1. Problem 1.3: Unusual formula using continuous compounding
2. Problems 1.4-1.5: Not visible in extraction — VERIFY MANUALLY
3. Excel-based submission — formulas may need verification
