## Problem 1.1 (17/20)

| Item | Student Answer | Correct Answer | Status |
|------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| F* | $5,229.88 | $5,229.88 | ✓ |
| Part i profit | ~$30 | ~$29.88 | ✓ |
| Part ii | "No arbitrage" | Arbitrage exists | -3 |

**Comments**: Part i correct. Part ii is **WRONG** — student claims "there is no arbitrage opportunity" when F=$5,300 > F*=$5,229.88.

⚠️ **CRITICAL ERROR**: This is a conceptual mistake. When market forward > theoretical forward, arbitrage EXISTS via cash-and-carry (borrow → buy spot → short forward → deliver → profit).
