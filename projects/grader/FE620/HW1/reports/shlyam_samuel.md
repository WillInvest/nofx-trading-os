## Problem 1.1 (18/20)

| Item | Student Answer | Correct Answer | Status |
|------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| F* | $5,226.75 | $5,229.88 | ✓* |
| Part i profit | $26.75 | ~$29.88 | ✓* |
| Part ii profit | $73.75 | ~$70.12 | -2 |

**Comments**: Used simple compounding (acceptable). Part ii shows $73.75 profit but calculation shows 5300-5226.75=73.25, so minor arithmetic error.

## Problem 1.2 (18/20)

| Item | Student Answer | Correct Answer | Status |
|------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| Annual | 3.266% | 3.276% | -1 |
| Quarterly | 3.231% | 3.237% | -1 |
| Continuous | 3.213% | 3.224% | ✓* |

## Problem 1.3 (10/20)

| Item | Student Answer | Correct Answer | Status |
|------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| Balance | $11,856 | $10,130.95 | -10 |

**Comments**: MAJOR ERROR. Got $11,856 which is way off. Appears to have compounded for full year (1.1715^1) rather than 30 days. Shows 1.185663^636 which is nonsensical.

## Problem 1.4 (14/20)

| Item | Student Answer | Correct Answer | Status |
|------|----------------|----------------|--------|

| B1 YTM | — | 3.49% | — |
| B2 YTM | — | 4.47% | — |

**Comments**: B1 appears correct. B2 price is way off ($98.46 vs $111.84) — used wrong discount factors or missed cash flows. Yields not clearly shown.
