## Problem 1.1 (18/20)

| Item | Student Answer | Correct Answer | Status |
|------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| F* | $5,226.75 | $5,229.88 | ✓* |
| Part i profit | $26.75 | ~$29.88 | ✓* |
| Part ii profit | $73.25 | ~$70.12 | ✓* |

**Comments**: Used simple compounding (1+r) instead of continuous (e^r). Both approaches are acceptable but give slightly different values. Arbitrage strategies correctly identified.

⚠️ **UNCERTAINTY**: The simple vs continuous compounding choice affects all profit calculations by ~$3. Depending on course convention, these answers may be considered fully correct.
