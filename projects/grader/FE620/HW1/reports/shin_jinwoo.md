## Problem 1.1 (17/20)

| Item | Student Answer | Correct Answer | Status |
|------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| F* | $5,226.75 | $5,229.88 | ✓* |
| Part i profit | $66.75 | ~$29.88 | -3 |
| Part ii profit | $33.25 | ~$70.12 | ✓* |

**Comments**: Used simple compounding (1+r) instead of continuous e^r, which is acceptable. However, part i calculation appears confused — profit should be F* - F = 5226.75 - 5200 = 26.75, not 66.75. Part ii correctly shows 5300 - 5266.75 = 33.25 (note: should be 5226.75 not 5266.75 — possible typo). Deduct 3 for numerical error.
