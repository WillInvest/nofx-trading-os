Looking at the solutions, I'll check each problem with focus on 1.2.

## Problem 1.2 Check

Given: $r_2 = 3.25\%$ (semi-annual compounding).

**i) Annual compounding ($m=1$):**

$r_1 = (1 + 0.0325/2)^2 - 1 = (1.01625)^2 - 1 = 1.03276406 - 1 = 0.03276$

Solution says **3.276%** ✅ Correct.

**ii) Quarterly compounding ($m=4$):**

$r_4 = 4\left[(1 + r_2/2)^{1/2} - 1\right] = 4\left[(1.01625)^{1/2} - 1\right]$

$(1.01625)^{0.5} = 1.008093...$

$r_4 = 4 \times 0.008093 = 0.032372$

Solution says **3.237%** — this is a minor rounding issue but essentially correct. More precisely it's **3.2372%**, so rounding to 3.237% is fine. ✅

**iii) Continuous compounding:**

$r_c = 2\ln(1 + 0.0325/2) = 2\ln(1.01625) = 2 \times 0.016119 = 0.032238$

Solution says **3.224%** — this should be **3.2237%**, so 3.224% is a slight rounding up but essentially correct. ✅

## Quick Check of Other Problems

**1.1:** $F^* = 5050 \times e^{0.035} = 5050 \times 1.03562 = 5229.88$ ✅. Arbitrage logic is correct in both parts.

**1.3:** The formula and logic are correct. One typo: the solution text says "compounding the initial amount $1000" when it should be **$10,000**, but the calculation uses $10,000 correctly. ✅

**1.4:** Prices and yields look reasonable given the zero curve. Would need to recompute cash flows to verify exact numbers, but the methodology is correct.

**1.5:**
- Part i) Gain = $1.0m \times (1.175 - 1.150) = \$25,000$ ✅
- Part ii): $r_{USD} - r_{EUR} = \frac{1}{0.5}\ln\frac{1.150}{1.100} = 2 \times 0.04445 = 0.08890$. The solution says this is **8.890%** but earlier writes **0.0816** — that's an inconsistency. The correct value is $2\ln(1.150/1.100) = 2 \times 0.04445 = 0.08890 = 8.890\%$. So the decimal **0.0816 is wrong**, but the percentage **8.890% is correct**. Looks like a typo in equation (5).

## Summary

The solutions are essentially correct. The main issues are:
- **Problem 1.3**: Typo "$1000" should be "$10,000" (calculation is fine)
- **Problem 1.5 part ii)**: The displayed decimal 0.0816 contradicts the correct answer of 8.890% (should be 0.08890)
- **Problem 1.2**: All correct, just minor rounding differences in the last decimal place
