# 2026-02-21 Session Notes

## Major Work Tonight (9PM - midnight)
- Installed Mem0 Cloud plugin (auto-recall + auto-capture)
- Added OpenAI API key to config
- Built Python Hyperliquid executor (kept but not deployed yet - staying with NOFX)
- Redesigned NOFX frontend: removed Data/Market/ETH/Backtest/Agents/FAQ tabs
- Added: ETH Node tab (on-chain intelligence), News tab (AI-curated), Price tab (K-line + indicators)
- Built news-scraper.py daemon (Gemma 3 4B, 5 RSS feeds, 30-day archive)
- Built 4 new ETH node collectors: mempool, whale tracker, DEX trades, liquidation scanner
- Built market-collector-live.py daemon (30s refresh)
- Redesigned SOUL.md with Token Economy rules (CEO model, dispatch template, review gate, escalation)
- Studied obra/superpowers + spec-kit + context engineering repos
- Built devops: deploy.sh, smoke-test.sh, rollback.sh, agent scorecard

## Key Decisions
- Stay with NOFX platform, modify rather than rebuild
- MiniMax = primary coder, always specify model explicitly
- Opus never reads code — describe goals, let MiniMax figure it out
- Review gate: second MiniMax reviews before deploy
- Design-first for big features

## Sub-Agent Activity
- 8+ MiniMax dispatches, all on MiniMax-M2.5
- Tasks: executor, dashboard, eth-node-page, news-page, eth-node-upgrade, news-overhaul, onchain-collectors, price-tab, devops-reliability

## Lessons Learned
- sessions_spawn inherits caller's model — ALWAYS pass model: "minimax/MiniMax-M2.5" explicitly
- ETHNodePage crashed because .toFixed() called on undefined — null-guard everything in dispatch instructions
- Don't read code as Opus — it's 10x more expensive and MiniMax can do it
