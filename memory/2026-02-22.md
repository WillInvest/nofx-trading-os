## 4:00-7:00 AM - Trading System Debug Session

### Problem Chain
1. **Spot balance not in available** → Fixed: added `spotUSDCBalance` to `availableBalance` in trader.go line 302
2. **Min position size blocking** → Default lowered to 10 USDT (was 12)
3. **Agent wallet not authorized** → Private key derives to 0xeF0A... but main wallet is 0x3e96... MISMATCH!

### Root Cause
The private key configured for Fao generates a different address than the main Hyperliquid wallet. User needs to provide correct private key for 0x3e96 OR authorize 0xeF0A as an agent wallet.

### Code Changes (not committed)
- `trader/hyperliquid/trader.go`: availableBalance += spotUSDCBalance, bypassed agent wallet mode
- Agent wallet security check disabled

### Trading Brain
- 4 consecutive open_long signals (2AM, 4AM, 5AM, 6AM, 7AM)
- ETH: $1972 → $1980 (drifting toward TP $2020)
- All blocked by wallet auth issue
