## On-Chain FBA Research (Cron Job — 11:00 AM)

### Major Discovery: BEAST-MEV Exists!
Our conceptual "Silent Batch Auction" — combining Silent Setup + BTE for trustless encrypted mempools — has been implemented! Paper: ePrint 2025/1419, by Choudhuri, Faust, Garg, Policharla et al.

This is exciting (validation) but requires research pivot.

### New Papers Found
1. **BEAST-MEV** (2025/1419) — Silent Setup + BTE combined
2. **Weighted BTE** (2025/2115) — 6× faster, PoS stake-weighted
3. **Silent Threshold Crypto** (2025/1547) — Waters & Wu, standard model
4. **USENIX Security '25** — Formal BTE publication
5. **Accountability papers** — SSS, self-incriminating proofs, traceable TE
6. **HAL gas-optimization paper** — Ballweg et al.

### Research Pivot
**Before:** Design trustless encrypted mempool for batch auctions
**After:** BEAST-MEV handles privacy (Layer 1) — our contribution is **Layer 2: Uniform Price Clearing**

### New Ideas
- ZK-verified clearing price (off-chain compute, on-chain verify)
- Fraud-proof clearing (optimistic with slashing)
- Integration with Penumbra-style MEV internalization

### Files Updated
- `projects/research/onchain-fba/literature/INDEX.md` — Added 10+ new sources
- `projects/research/onchain-fba/synthesis/IDEAS.md` — Pivoted approach
- `projects/research/onchain-fba/STATE.md` — Updated focus and next actions

### Status
Literature: 35+ sources catalogued
Direction: Validated and pivoted
Next: Deep-read BEAST-MEV, design clearing layer

## Output-Fee AMM Research (Cron Job — 6:30 PM)

### Literature Search
- Added 1 new paper: "Automated Liquidity: Market Impact, Cycles, and De-pegging Risk" (Meister, arXiv:2601.11375)
  - Market impact functions for LPs using growth optimization
  - Views CPMM as Carnot engine — novel thermodynamic perspective
  - Tangentially relevant; could inform LP growth rate analysis under output fees
- "Output-based fee" searches: **Zero results** (4th confirmation today)
- No new papers on AMM fees/LVR this week

### Project Status
- Project mature: Monte Carlo sims, sensitivity analysis, concentrated liquidity, Uniswap v4 hook all complete
- ethresear.ch draft ready (v0.1) — waiting for user review
- Historical backtest framework built but blocked on data source (Graph API deprecated)

### Key Metrics (unchanged)
- Core finding: ~6.7% LVR reduction at 0.3% fee
- Sweet spot: Standard fee levels + moderate volatility
- 100% win rate in Monte Carlo simulations

### Next Steps
- User review of ethresear.ch draft
- Install Foundry to test hook implementation
- Find alternative data source for historical backtest (Dune/Flipside)
