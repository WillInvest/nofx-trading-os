## On-Chain FBA Research Cron (10:00 PM)

Ran Saturday night research routine for the On-Chain FBA project.

### Key Findings

1. **ERC-8004 Agent Economy — Explosive Adoption**
   - 24,000+ agents registered on mainnet in first week
   - The Graph backing ERC-8004 + x402 standards
   - MultiversX integrated x402 (cross-chain adoption)
   - x402 hackathon in SF with Google, Coinbase, SKALE
   - Agent-compatible order format now PRODUCTION REQUIREMENT, not v2

2. **RNBW Auction — Empirical Validation**
   - Cleared at $0.13 (started $0.10)
   - +30% price discovery
   - FDV ~$130M at clearing
   - Proves CCA price discovery works in production

3. **Glamsterdam — On Track**
   - bals-devnet-2 launched Feb 4
   - Scope freeze end of February
   - Mainnet May/June 2026
   - Vitalik's "Glamsterdam Ultimatum" — L2 criticism driving L1 focus

4. **Witness Encryption Progress**
   - BABE paper: Bitcoin proof verification 1000× cheaper via WE
   - Validates WE as research track
   - Keep threshold (BEAST-MEV) for production

### Files Updated
- `projects/research/onchain-fba/STATE.md` — Added 10PM cron update
- `projects/research/onchain-fba/literature/INDEX.md` — 10 new sources, 110+ total
- `projects/research/onchain-fba/synthesis/IDEAS.md` — Agent economy section, WE progress

### Report Sent
Delivered research summary to main session via Telegram.

### Strategic Decisions CONFIRMED ✅
1. **Agent priority**: V1 REQUIRED — 24k first week proves real demand
2. **Chainlink outreach**: YES — Manuel Vidigueira, angle: "accountability layer for EIP-8105 clearing"
3. **RNBW validation**: Confirms uniform clearing works in production (+30% price discovery)

### Next Research Cycle (Feb 9-15)
- Uniswap CCA source code analysis
- Draft ERC-8004 compatible order format
- Prototype ZK clearing circuit
- Benchmark ZK vs fraud-proof gas costs

## Output-Fee AMM Research Cron (2:30 AM)

### Literature Search (12th check)
- **"Output-based fee" AMM search: ZERO results** — 12th consecutive confirmation of research gap
- Searched: arXiv CFMM/LVR, ethresear.ch, Uniswap v4 hooks research
- ethresear.ch: Only older MEV-capturing AMM posts (2020-2024), nothing on output fees

### New Paper Added
- **"Rebalancing-versus-Rebalancing" (Willetts, arXiv:2410.23404, Oct 2024)**
  - Introduces RVR — higher-fidelity benchmark vs LVR
  - Key finding: AMMs often outperform CEX rebalancing at realistic fee levels
  - Complements our output-fee research but doesn't address fee structure

### Project Status
- **Research gap strongly confirmed** across 12 independent literature checks
- Historical backtest complete: output fees win at ALL fee rates (0.1%-2.0%)
- ethresear.ch draft ready for user review
- Hook implementation + tests complete (pending Foundry install to run)

### No Further Action Needed
- Project mature — waiting on user review of ethresear.ch draft
- No new theoretical developments needed
- Consider reducing cron frequency or focusing on user review
