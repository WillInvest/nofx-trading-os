# Mem0 Integration — Feb 21, 2026

## Completed
- mem0ai v1.0.4 installed (Python)
- Qdrant vector DB running on :6333 (Docker, data at workspace/data/qdrant/)
- nomic-embed-text embedding model on Ollama (768 dims, free)
- DeepSeek V3 used for fact extraction (high quality, cheap)
- Ingested 8 NOFX-related files → 100 structured memories in Qdrant
- CLI tool: `bin/mem0-service.py` (add/search/get/ingest)
- Search quality verified: accurate retrieval of trading decisions, architecture, on-chain data

## Also Fixed
- Debate engine Docker build: missing backtick in engine.go, added breakout action, fixed unused var
- Cron parser: `coins` key not `coin_results`
- PEPE already replaced with LDO in Go code
- Container rebuilt and deployed

## TODO
- Swap DeepSeek V3 → local model for daily extraction (find good 7B+ that handles tool calling)
- Hook mem0 into heartbeat/cron for auto-saving debate results
- Pre-compaction hook to save conversations before OpenClaw compacts
