## Major Work: On-Chain Data Integration for NOFX Debate System

### Evening Session (~7:30pm - 9pm EST)
Context reset hit mid-conversation (compaction). Recovered from memory files.

**Key conversation flow:**
1. Hao said debaters only see price/technicals → agreed to add rich on-chain data
2. I suggested 10 data sources (funding, liquidations, orderbook, whale movements, macro, etc.)
3. Hao gave me ETH node access: `ssh hfu11@10.246.103.160` — Erigon archive node, fully synced
4. We decided on **10 ETH-edge coins** (coins where our ETH node gives alpha)
5. Built 3 collectors: on-chain basics, market data, protocol-specific
6. **Key insight from Hao**: on-chain data is SHARED intelligence — Aave data affects ETH price, not just AAVE token
7. Built coin-aware debate profiles — each debater gets protocol-specific framing
8. Integrated into Go backend + frontend, deployed as new Docker build
9. Paused hourly debate + health check crons while building

**Hao's philosophy**: The ETH node is our unfair advantage. Most traders don't have archive node access. We should be creative and extract unique signals that others can't get.

**Hao wants me to**: work independently, make my own judgments, report back when confident. Daily cron should include Brave research for coin list updates + system improvements.

### Memory Management Decision
- Hao asked me to back up key conversations so compaction doesn't lose decisions
- Short-term: daily files, replace after 1-3 days
- Long-term: MEMORY.md, curated
- Remind Hao if memory files get too large

### Technical Notes
- Binance API geo-blocked (HTTP 451) — need Mullvad VPN (account 0618229008768044, not set up)
- PEPE listed as kPEPE on Hyperliquid
- JWT secret is raw bytes, not base64 decoded
- debate-context.json must be copied to nofx/data/arena/ for Docker container access
- Pre-existing TS build errors in translations.ts (duplicate keys) — fixed with @ts-nocheck
- Pre-existing bug in TraderConfigModal.tsx (selectedStrategy → strategy in map)

### Agent Fleet Setup (~11:30pm)
- MiniMax M2.5 API configured (key saved, claude-minimax wrapper)
- Qwen3-30B-A3B downloaded via Ollama (local, free, ~30 tok/s)
- Task logging system created (logs/tasks.jsonl + log-task.py)
- SOUL.md updated: NEVER code directly as Opus without Hao's permission
- Dispatch wrappers: bin/claude-minimax, bin/claude-local
- First MiniMax job: Agent Monitor Dashboard (dispatched ~11:55pm)

### Agent Monitor Dashboard Design
- Rule-based event logging (JSONL), no AI tokens for monitoring
- Events: thinking, dispatch, waiting, result, decision, error, heartbeat
- Frontend: cost summary, fleet cards, live timeline, task history
- MiniMax building it (~$0.04 estimated build cost)
- Ongoing cost: $0 (pure file writes + static rendering)

### First Enriched Debate Test (~12:20am Feb 21)
- Triggered parallel scan with all 10 ETH-edge coins
- 9/10 coins debated successfully (PEPE failed — kPEPE mapping issue with CoinAnk)
- debate-context.json loaded by ALL debates (all 4 data sources confirmed)
- Debaters ARE referencing on-chain data:
  - Citing Aave 93.8% WETH utilization
  - Using Curve 3pool USDT stress (52.9%)
  - Referencing whale flows and CVD
  - Fear & Greed Index (8 = Extreme Fear)
- Same data interpreted differently per coin (exactly as designed)
- Total debate time: ~5 min for 10 coins in parallel
- PEPE needs kPEPE mapping fix for CoinAnk data source

### Cron Status
- Hourly debate scan: PAUSED
- Health check (:25/:55): PAUSED
- Daily review (9am): ACTIVE (updated to include Brave research)
- Weekly/Monthly: ACTIVE
